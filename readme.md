## Square Roots by Newton's Method

`sqrt` computes square roots. It uses Newton's method of successive approximations, which says that whenever we have a guess `y` for the value of the square root of a number `x`, we can perform a simple manipulation to get a better guess (one closer to the acqual square root) by averaging `y` with `x/y`. 

The original code written in Scheme is in a section **1.1.7 Example: Square Roots by Newtonâ€™s Method**.

## Fibonacci Numbers

`fib` computes Fibonacci numbers.

The original code written in Scheme is in a section **1.2.2 Tree Recursion**.

## Pascal's Triangle

The following pattern of numbers is called Pascal's triangle.

```
        1
      1   1
    1   2   1
  1   3   3   1
1   4   6   4   1
```

The numbers at the edge of the triangle are all 1, and each number inside the triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it.
