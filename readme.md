A list of random TypeScript code snippets from the book [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/index.xhtml).

## sqrt

`sqrt` computes square roots. It uses Newton's method of successive approximations, which says that whenever we have a guess `y` for the value of the square root of a number `x`, we can perform a simple manipulation to get a better guess (one closer to the acqual square root) by averaging `y` with `x/y`. 

The original code written in Scheme is in a section **1.1.7 Example: Square Roots by Newtonâ€™s Method**.

## fib

`fib` computes Fibonacci numbers.

The original code written in Scheme is in a section **1.2.2 Tree Recursion**.
